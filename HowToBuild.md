SimpleValidator
==============

## How to build

This is an **Ant-based** project, so you can build it with Ant.
But if you feel more comfortable to use other build tool such as Maven, you are free to do so.
You can just copy & paste the template code into your project

## Note:
For this Java version implementation, 
you don't really need to make the build to print "**Valid**" or "**Invalid**" like what "**checker.exe**" does in the Take-home-coding-test descriptioin page
you just need to implement **SimpleXmlValidator.determineXml** and test it in the **main()** method
